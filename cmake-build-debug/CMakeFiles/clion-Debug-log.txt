CMake Error at vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package):
  By not providing "Finddoctest.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "doctest", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "doctest" with any
  of the following names:

    doctestConfig.cmake
    doctest-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "doctest" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "doctest_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "doctest" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
